### About Me

Researcher engaged in social, scientific causes, supporting social and software freedom.

* Post-Doctorate in progress, in partnership with the Universidade Federal Fluminense, supported by the PDR-10/FAPERJ program.
* Doctor in Electrical Engineering, in the field of Computational Intelligence, by the Pós-Graduação em Engenharia Elétrica (PPGEE) the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), with an exchange period at the University of Sheffield (England), in partnership with the Rolls Royce Technology Center in Control and Systems Engineering, and at ORT Braude College of Engineering (Israel), as a Marie Curie researcher for the European Commission as part of the Seventh Framework Program.
* Bachelor's degree in Control Engineering and Automation by the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP) with sandwich period, funded by the Sciences without Borders program, at Universat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona / Spain).
* Technician in Electronic Instrumentation and Process Control by the Instituto Federal de Minas Gerais with internship at the mining area of Alegria, working for the VALE S. A.


The main area I have been acting is artificial intelligence, focusing on the following research topics: mono and multi-objective combinatorial optimization, metaheuristics, trajectory search algorithms, evolutionary computation, evolutionary strategies, mathematical programming, optimization techniques applied to smart-microgrids, Renewable energy integration with mini/microgrid systems, autonomy of intelligent networks, energy storage management, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration technologies, mining planning, multi-agent systems, time series forecasting methods, machine learning, scheduling/timetabling, vehicle routing, operational and marketing research, adaptive and self-calibrated PID controllers, and development of computational frameworks.


Participant of the Grupo de Otimização e Algoritmos (GOAL/UFOP), LAGO/UFF, Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MINDS/UFMG).
Member of the Instituto de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento de Tecnologias (IPDT), Ouro Preto/MG, Brazil.

One of the idealizerers of the [Grupo da Causa Humana](https://github.com/CausaHumana) (GCH), Ouro Preto/MG, Brazil, [Creating.City](https://github.com/CreatingCity) and [NeoResearch Community](https://github.com/NeoResearch).

I have been effectively working and researching on solving combinatorial optimization problems for real-world applications, spreading this knowledge and software to small, medium and large size global companies (such as INDITEX).

Check my [LATTES - CV](http://lattes.cnpq.br/8931047228585695), usually it is the one that is most updated, with current projects and conference papers.
While most parts are in Portuguese :) I believe you gonna have an interesting journey throughout my mother language, which, is, by the way, a beautiful language (such as the others ones).
